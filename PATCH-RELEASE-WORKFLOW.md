## 🏗️ Patch Versioning Strategy

### **Semantic Versioning for Patches**
```
v1.0.1 = MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
         ↑     ↑     ↑
         │     │     └── Patch number (1, 2, 3...)
         │     └────────── Minor version (unchanged for patches)
         └──────────────── Major version (unchanged for patches)
```

### **Version Examples**
| Version | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `v1.0.0` | Base Release | Original v1.0 release |
| `v1.0.1` | First Patch | First patch to v1.0.0 |
| `v1.0.2` | Second Patch | Second patch to v1.0.0 |
| `v1.1.0` | Minor Release | New features release |
| `v1.1.1` | First Patch | First patch to v1.1.0 |
| `v1.1.2` | Second Patch | Second patch to v1.1.0 |

## 🚀 Patch Deployment Workflow

### **Phase 1: Validation (5-15 minutes)**
```
Activities:
├── Automated testing suite
├── Security vulnerability scan
├── Performance regression tests
└── Compatibility verification

Success Criteria:
├── All tests pass
├── No new security issues
├── Performance within baseline
└── Backward compatibility confirmed
```

### **Phase 2: Demo Deployment (5 minutes)**
```
Target: Demo environments
Method: Immediate automatic deployment
Purpose: Smoke testing in live environment

Activities:
├── Deploy to demo environment
├── Smoke test critical paths
├── Verify new functionality
└── Confirm system stability
```

### **Phase 3: Customer Rollout (Variable)**
```
Rollout Strategy: Based on patch type and customer policy

Security Patches (Critical):
├── All customers: Immediate rollout
├── No confirmation required
├── Enhanced monitoring activated
└── Emergency communication sent

Bug Fix Patches (Medium):
├── Startup: 2-hour delay
├── Standard: 6-hour delay  
├── Enterprise: 12-hour delay
└── Pre-deployment notifications

Performance Patches (Low):
├── Maintenance window deployment
├── Customer-specific scheduling
├── Performance monitoring
└── Gradual rollout validation
```
